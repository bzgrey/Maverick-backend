# Improve concepts: explain how to better structure these two concepts

Thinking more about scheduling only dealing with event ids would make the scheduling concept almost useless. When you have a sync that when a user requests alignschedules for example, in the where one would filter through the frames by querying courseRegistering, as defined in the repo rn, but in the then clause, it's not clear to me what scheduling would add to the functionality. How can I better structure the scheduling and courseRegistering concepts to do what I want while following the concept background?
