# 4. Visualizing Overlapping Schedules May Be Too Complex

Risk:\
Displaying multiple students’ schedules together in a clean, understandable UI may be harder than expected. Building an interactive calendar that can show overlaps, highlight conflicts, and scale for groups may lead to cluttered visuals or require more front-end engineering than planned.

Mitigation:

* Start with simple static visualizations (e.g., a weekly grid) and layer interactivity gradually.

* Use existing TypeScript-compatible libraries for calendar rendering instead of building from scratch.

* Build modular UI components that handle small parts of the visualization (individual schedules, pairwise comparison, etc.) and test them independently.

* Conduct quick user testing to refine layout before committing to full-scale implementation.

Fallback:

* If adding schedules on top of each other in the UI is too difficult, will resort to user just seeing their schedule page, and when they click on a course in their schedule they can see a list of other friends/group members taking that same course at the same time instead of visually showing schedule blocks overlapping.
