# Original Functional Design

\*\*

### Functional design

The functional design is like the one you did for the personal project, augmented with the development plan.

The deliverables are:

Problem framing: A revision of your problem framing to reflect your latest understanding

Concept design: A collection of concept specifications and syncs; include a note section in each concept and sync to explain any non-obvious design decisions or to mark issues to be resolved.

* Friends (aka Friending) (also in Context)- one concept if doesn’t exceed bounds of visibility (yabetse)

* Visibility (aka Showing) (also in Contex) (yabetse)

* Groups (aka Grouping) (Giani)

* Preference/Ranking (betsegaw)

* Courses / Course Catalog (aka CourseRegistering/Availability) (betsegaw)

* Schedule \[User, Group] (actions: similarity, add course, remove course,  (also in Context) (benny)

aka= changing concepts to resembling units of behavior

Testing idea:

-lightweight enough to create different repos to create different versions of app where you can simultaneously test different ideas/features since concepts are independent

SOLID

* UserAuthentication (Giani)

* Session (Giani)

User journey: a narrative that follows a single stakeholder as they encounter the problem and use your designed app to address it.

UI sketches: low-fidelity sketches of your user interface that show the primary user interface elements and their rough layout, annotated with pointers or comments to explain anything that might not be obvious.

Visual design study: two slides (which can be inserted into markdown as images) that establish the “look and feel” of your app by assembling a range of sources and annotating them to establish a visual style with typographic, color and layout.

Design summary: A summary of the overall design: how the concepts work together to solve the problem; how the design addresses any concerns that your ethics analysis raised; which issues remain unclear.

Development plan: A table showing which features you expect to deliver at various stages, including at least the two checkpoints; an assignment of responsibilities to team members; a discussion of the key risks you face and how you will mitigate them (and your fallback option will be if something turns out to be unimplementable).
