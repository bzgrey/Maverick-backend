# designSummary

\*\*

Project Updates

### Project: CourseConnect

Team: Maverick’s Design\
Date & Time: 12/04/25

***

## 1. Agenda:

* ### Progress Since Last Meeting

* ### Design Changes

* ### Issues & Questions

* ### Future Plans

* ### Set Next Meeting Date

***

## 2. Progress Since Last Meeting

* ### Yabetse:

* Implemented user page, which shows incoming and outgoing friend requests, list of current friends

* Implemented front end and back end for Friending and Blocking

* Cleaned up and improved schedule component design

* ### Betsegaw:

* Implemented Preferencing concept backend

* Added preferencing concept to the frontend illustrating visually whenever users are likely or not likely to take courses

* Fixed up course parsing scripts including additional information to parse by, allowing for more enhanced course filtering and additional info to be displayed for each class

* ### Benny:

* Create user schedule diffs in the scheduling component, now we are able to see up to three users compared side by side (including yourself)

* Worked on several backend synchronizations that greatly simplify frontend calls to the backend.

* ### Giani:

* Implemented Grouping concept in the backend and frontend, allowing users to join a group and view all of the user schedules in that group along with all of their friends

* Add variable number of course types events, allowing for Lectures, Recitations, Labs, and Design events.

***

## 3. Design Changes

* Change: Restricted number of use schedules that can be compared at once to three.\
  Reason: Allowing for more than three cluttered the calendar too much and made analysis overwhelming for the users.

Besides this everything stayed on track as before! Just continuing to implement the newer and more advanced features

***

## 4. Issues & Questions

* Questions: What else should we do with the site?

* Answer: Focus on what visually the frontend allows for the users. Specifically we discussed that the scheduling diffs didn’t really help the users figure out what was going on, but if we were to combine events from the same course that would enhance the visual help to the user

* Issue: Facing lots of performance issues with many queries being sent to the backend.

* Answer: Focus on the main bottleneck of the system and finding a good solution for that. It is very easy to fall down a rabbit hole of optimizing performance, but that there is probably one main thing that can optimize the system greatly.

***

## 5. Future Plans

Visual Affordance: click top list of courses so that when you click in the calendar view shows that course and list of friends taking it displayed on there

* Idea:

*  Create a border where multiple users have likely to take for the same class at the same time to show it is favorable 

* For showing similarity between classes instead of separating same classes from different users make it one block split into the colors

* For user page it is very homogeneous so look at examples of ui’s so it is obvious where friends, groups, and blocked in a more semantic way 

* ### Yabetse:

* Clean up UI and make it match the visual design study results

* Do user testing with a friend

* Implement one feature from the user testing

* ### Betsegaw:

* Thing: Preferencing (Maybe, Likely, Definitely), Add additional course filtering and info

* Bring in even more course info, making the app more informative for users

* Do the user testing with a friend

* Implement a feature that came up from the user testing

* ### Benny:

* Create task list for user testing, and create user stories for Yabetse and Betsegaw to go through during user testing

* Include blocking for friends within \_getUserSchedule sync

* Implement the feature to improve on visual affordance by combining meeting events of the same course, and splitting the same block by the same color

* ### Giani:

* Figure out how to optimize backend calling to improve frontend performance

* Implement additional feature to enhance visual affordance

* Help with any other feature that may come up from user testing

* Come up with design change based on the 

* Design change based on user testing

## Next Meeting Date/Time:

None! Full demo submission!

* ### Issues & Questions

* ### Future Plans

* ### Set Next Meeting Date

***

## 2. Progress Since Last Meeting

* ### Yabetse:

* Updated specs for Blocking and Friending and completed implementation for Blocking and Friending

* Brainstormed risks and mitigations 

* ### Betsegaw:

* Started implementation of Preferencing concept and CourseCataloging concept using Context tool 

* ### Benny:

* Split up specs for CourseScheduling

* Scheduling Concept implementation and testing

* CourseCatalog concept implementation and testing

* ### Giani:

* UserAuthentication and Sessioning - Ported over concept specs from ConceptBox into our backend for authentication use

* UI Sketch - Iterated on several versions of frontend sketches, ultimately landing on a sketch the whole team is happy to move forward with

* Grouping - Wrote thorough Grouping concept with a variety of well thought out queries and actions, along with several syncs with Sessioning/UserAuthentication and Blocking filters

***

## 3. Design Changes

* Change: splitting CourseScheduling again into two concepts Scheduling and CourseCatalogue\
  Reason: Scheduling and CourseCatalog have distinct purposes

* Change:\
  Reason:

***

## 4. Issues & Questions

* Issue: syncs for multiple related queries

* Answer: The essence of concepts is an action that is being performed, therefore it will be necessary for synchronizations to connect several concepts

* When request for schedule

* Where: 2 queries: 1 gets events, and 1 gets details

* Then respond 

* Issue: CourseScheduling or Cataloging + Scheduling?

* Answer: Cataloging + Scheduling

* Issue: Flat lists in sync and return types of concept actions and queries?

* Answer:

* Issue: Should queries be implemented with a success response if they don’t return anything? \[Giani]

* Answer:

* Issue: Confusion regarding where/when clauses for synchronization responses. \[Giani]

* Answer:

*

***

## 5. Future Plans

* ### Yabetse:

* Will collaborate with Benni and Giani on testing syncs on the front end

* Implementation of user profile on front end 

* Notes:

* Rendered Schedule vs Scheduling behavorial concept are different things

* For rendered schedule on the front end you can use multiple quereis from different concepts via syncs

* When requesting. Get Calendar

* Where: requesting.getCalendar

* getUser

* CourseCatalog for 

* Frames notes:

* When doing frames.query you are appending information to frames

* Also second parameter in query is the input for the action

* Scheduling sync

* ### Betsegaw: 

* Finish hydrant course data component by Thursday night, also Schedule component frontend by Friday/Saturday

* Other

* ### Benny:

* Thing

* Other

* ### Giani:

* Course Info Component - Develop course information component for the frontend that displays all of the data associated with a course, but most importantly the friends associated with each Lecture + Recitation

* Course Search Component - Allow basic searching of courses that you can select that will then pop into the course info component
