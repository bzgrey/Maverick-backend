# 2. FERPA-Adjacent Privacy & Safety Risks

Risk:\
An adversary could guess or access someone’s class schedule, which could create stalking, harassment, or safety concerns.

Mitigation:

* Require MIT email verification through OAuth (Touchstone / Duo).

* Schedules visible only to accepted friends, never public.

* Allow blacklist controls

Fallback:\
If we cannot guarantee safe schedule visibility:

* Restrict sharing to aggregate similarity scores (“You share 2 classes”), without showing exact times.

* Remove schedule views entirely except for private self-use
