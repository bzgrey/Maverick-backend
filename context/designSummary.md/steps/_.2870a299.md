# 1. Hydrant Scripts Not Working on Our End

Risk:\
Translating Hydrant’s python scripts for web scrapping mit course catalog for getting course doesn’t translate nicely into typescript to be used in our back end. 

Mitigation:

* Validate Output Against Hydrant’s Reference Data: After translating each module, compare JSON output to the original Hydrant JSON to ensure accuracy and completeness before integration.

* Modular Translation Approach: Break Hydrant’s Python scraper into small logical parts (fetching HTML, parsing, cleaning, structuring data) and translate each part incrementally rather than rewriting everything at once.

* For performance issues: Cache Scraped Data: Reduce the need to run the TypeScript scraper frequently by caching results and updating them periodically.

Fallback:

* Option A: Keep Hydrant’s Python scraper as-is and run it as a separate service or cron job that outputs JSON files your TypeScript backend can read.

* Option B: Switch to direct HTML scraping of the MIT catalog or Registrar website using simpler, TypeScript-native web-scraping libraries.

* Option C: Worst case scenario have users upload their CourseRoad exported files. CourseRoad allows users to export their schedules into json, could then parse through this and cache courses, so they won’t need to be updated later. Assigning times and days will be difficult here, and so users may need to manually add they times and days for that course.
