# 3. Users Don’t Adopt the App (Network Effect Problem)

Risk:\
A scheduling-with-friends app only becomes useful when many friends join. Early adoption can be slow.

Mitigation:

* Make the app fully useful even with 0 friends (individual schedule planner and course discovery through a course catalog)

* Initially create targeted groups for MIT like one for each current class, different dorms, etc to encourage users to join public groups if they don’t have individual friends on the app

Fallback:\
If adoption remains low:

* Pivot to a personal smart-scheduler with optional friend features.

* Add a “public groups” feature (e.g., clubs, dorms, majors) so usefulness doesn’t depend solely on individual friends.
