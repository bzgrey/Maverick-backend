# response:

Of course. Here is the updated `CourseRegistering` concept specification.

The `Course` definition within the `state` has been modified to include separate, structured identifiers for `Lecture` and an optional `Recitation`. This provides a more realistic and flexible model for university courses, where different components have their own schedules. The actions and principles have been updated accordingly to handle this new structure.
