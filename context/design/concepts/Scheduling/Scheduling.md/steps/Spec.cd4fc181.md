# Spec: write specs for a scheduling concept

This concept should fasciliate users creating schedules of classes with times.  Just use a generic event, not classes to identify events. There should be an action to compare schedules too. Each user has a single schedule, so there should be a set of users with a schedule. The schedule can have multiple events with times, and there can be overlapping events
