# concept: Scheduling

**concept**: Scheduling \[User, Event]
**purpose**: Track events in one's schedule and compare with others
**principle**: If a user adds different events to their schedule, they can then compare schedules and see which events they have in common.

**types**:

* `MeetingTime`:
  * a set of `days` (e.g., {Tuesday, Thursday})
  * a `startTime` of type `Time`
  * an `endTime` of type `Time`

**state**:

* a set of Users with
  * a Schedule
* a set of Schedules with
  * a user User
  * a set of Events
* a set of Events with
  * a name String (could be the Course name)
  * a type String (Lecture/Recitation/Lab/other)
  * a MeetingTime
  * an optional user User

**actions:**

* **`createSchedule (user: User): (schedule: Schedule)`**
  * **requires**: The given `user` does not already have a schedule.
  * **effects**: Creates a new, empty `Schedule` `s`; associates `s` with the `user`; returns the new `Schedule`'s identifier as `schedule`.
* **`addEvent (event: Event, name: String, type: String, time: MeetingTime, user?: User)`**
  * **requires**: the `event` isn't already in the set of Events
  * **effects**: Adds the `event` to the set of Events with the given info
* **`removeEvent (event: Event, user?: User)`**
  * **requires**: The `event` is in set of events; If a user is given, then the event must have this user
  * **effects**: Removes the `event` from the `user`'s schedule.
* scheduleEvent (user: User, event: Event)
  * **requires**: The `user` has a schedule; the `event` is in the set of Events
  * **effects**: Adds the `event` to the `user`'s schedule.
* **`unscheduleEvent (user: User, event: Event)`**
  * **requires**: The `user` has a schedule, and the `event` is in the `user`'s schedule.
  * **effects**: Removes the `event` from the `user`'s schedule.

**queries**:

* **`_getUserSchedule(user: User):(event: Event, name: String, type: String, times: MeetingTime)[]`**
  * **requires**: The `user` has a schedule.
  * **effects**: Returns a set of all events (id's) in the user's schedule with their names, types, and times
* **`_getScheduleComparison (user1: User, user2: User): events: Event[]`**
  * **requires**: Both `user1` and `user2` have schedules.
  * **effects**: Returns the common event id's between the schedules of user1 and user
