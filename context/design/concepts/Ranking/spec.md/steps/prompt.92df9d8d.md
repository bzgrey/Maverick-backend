# prompt: create basic ("pseudo code") syncs for Ranking and CourseRegistering that are user-facing, i.e. when some request happens where Sessioning.\_getUser(session) associated with current user then call the concept's actions. Then, provide example syncs that connnect CourseRegistering with Ranking. For example if CourseRegistering had a removeCourse action then when that happens all associated Rankings should be removed too
