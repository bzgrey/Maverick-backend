Here are the specifications and implementations for the remaining concepts (**CourseCatalog**, **Scheduling**, **Sessioning**, **UserAuthentication**, **Grouping**) and the **Synchronizations** that tie them all together, specifically enforcing the logic that friends can see schedules unless blocked.
