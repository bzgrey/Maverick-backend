# concept: Grouping \[User]

* **purpose**: Manage the lifecycle of groups and their membership.

* **principle**: An admins creates a private Group, allowing future users to request to join, inviting and removing members, and managing member roles (such as owner or administrator). It provides the fundamental mechanics of association that can be used for a wide variety of features, such as team collaboration, social clubs, or access control lists.

* **state**:
  * a set of `Group`s with
    * a `name` String
    * a `members` set of User
    * a `memberRoles` map from unique ID to Role (`ADMIN` | `MEMBER`)
    * a `requests` set of User (e.g., `User` requesting to join)

* **actions**:

* `createGroup (name: String, admin: User): (group: Group)`
  * **requires**: no Group exists with the given `name`.
  * **effects**: create new `group` with `name` name, `admin` as only member in `members`, `admin` having role `ADMIN` in `memberRoles`, and returns `group`.

* `deleteGroup (group: Group)`
  * **requires**: the given `group` exists.
  * **effects**: deletes the given `group` and its association with its members.

* `renameGroup (group: Group, newName: String)`
  * **requires**: the given `group` exists and no other Group has the `newName`.
  * **effects**: updates the `name` of the `group` to `newName`.

* `confirmRequest (group: Group, requester: User)`
  * **requires**: the given `group` exists and `group.requests` contains `requester`.
  * **effects**: adds the `requester` to `group.members`, adds `requester` to `group.memberRoles` as `MEMBER`, deletes associated `requester` `group.requests`.

* `declineRequest (group: Group, requester: User)`
  * **requires**: the given `group` exists and `group.requests` contains `requester`.
  * **effects**: deletes the `requester` from `group.requests`.

* `requestToJoin (group: Group, requester: User)`
  * **requires**: the given `group` exists and the `requester` isn't already in `group`.
  * **effects**: creates request in `group.requests` for \`requester.

* `adjustRole (group: Group, member: User, newRole: String)`
  * **requires**: `group` exists, `group.members` contains `member`, and `newRole` is `ADMIN` | `MEMBER`
  * **effects**: updates `group.memberRoles` for `member` to be `newRole`

* **queries**:

* `_getMembers (group: Group): (member: User)`
  * **requires** `group` exists
  * **effects** returns the set of all users in the `members` set of the given `group`

* `_getAdmins (group: Group): (admin: User)`
  * **requires** `group` exists
  * **effects** returns the set of all users in the `admins` set of the given `group`

* `_getRequests (group: Group): (requestingUser: User)`
  * **requires** `group` exists
  * **effects** returns the set of all users in the `requests` set of the given `group`

* `_getGroupByName (name: String): (group: Group)`
  * **requires** a group `g` with `g.name = name` exists
  * **effects** returns the group `g`

- **concept**: Preferencing \[User, Item]

- **purpose**: To allow a user to assign a personal numerical score to a single item at a time, and to query this score.

- **principle**: Each user can assign a score to at most one item at any given time. Assigning a score to an item (either new or existing) replaces any previously held item and score for that user.

- **state**:
  * A set of `Users` with
    * an `item` of type `Item`
    * a `score` of type `Number`

- **actions**:
  * `addScore (user: User, item: Item, score: Number)`
    * **requires**: The `user` must not currently have an `item` and `score` assigned. The `score` must be a valid number.
    * **effects**: Assigns the given `item` and `score` to the `user`.
  * `updateScore (user: User, item: Item, score: Number)`
    * **requires**: The `user` must already have the specified `item` assigned. The `score` must be a valid number.
    * **effects**: Updates the `score` for the `user`'s assigned `item` to the new value.
  * `removeScore (user: User, item: Item)`
    * **requires**: The `user` must have the specified `item` assigned to them.
    * **effects**: Clears the `item` and `score` from the `user`'s record, removing the preference.

- **queries**:
  * `_getScore (user: User, item: Item): (score: Number)`
    * **requires**: `user` exists and `item` is associated with `user`
    * **outputs**: return `score` associated with `item`

  * `_getAllItems(user: User): (items: Item[])`
    * **requires** `user` exists
    * **effects**: list of Item `items` associated with the `user` is returned
