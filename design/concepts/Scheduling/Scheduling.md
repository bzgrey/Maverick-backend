# concept: Scheduling

*   **concept**: Scheduling \[User, Event]
*   **purpose**: Track events in a person's schedule and compare with others
*   **principle**: If a user adds different events to their schedule, they can then compare schedules and see which events they have in common. 
*   **state**:

    ```
    a set of Users with
      a schedule Schedule

    a set of Schedules with
      an events set of Events

    ```

*   **actions**

    **`createSchedule (user: User): (schedule: Schedule)`**
    *   **requires**: The given `user` does not already have a schedule.
    *   **effects**: Creates a new, empty `Schedule` `s`; associates `s` with the `user`; returns the new `Schedule`'s identifier as `schedule`.

    **`addEvent (user: User, event: Event)`**
    *   **requires**: The `user` has a schedule; the `event` isn't already in the schedule
    *   **effects**: Adds the `event` to the `user`'s schedule.


    **`removeEvent (user: User, event: Event)`**
    *   **requires**: The `user` has a schedule, and the `event` is in the `user`'s schedule.
    *   **effects**: Removes the `event` from the `user`'s schedule.

    **`deleteEvent (event: Event)`**
    *   **requires**: The `event` exists.
    *   **effects**: removes the `event` from any Schedule that contains it.


*   **queries**: Reads of the concept state.

    **`_getUserSchedule (user: User): events: Event[]`**
    *   **requires**: The `user` has a schedule.
    *   **effects**: Returns a set of all events (id's) in the user's schedule

    **`_getScheduleComparison (user1: User, user2: User): events: Event[]`**
    *   **requires**: Both `user1` and `user2` have schedules.
    *   **effects**: Returns the common event id's between the schedules of user1 and user2
