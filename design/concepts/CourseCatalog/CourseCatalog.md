 # concept: CourseCatalog

**concept:** CourseCatalog\[Event]
**purpose**: Track the courses offered in a school with all of the information for each course regarding times, class types, name
**principle**: One can define courses with their given information and then access the information to each course

**types**:
  * `MeetingTime`:
    * a set of `days` (e.g., {Tuesday, Thursday})
    * a `startTime` of type `Time`
    * an `endTime` of type `Time`
  * `Tag`: one of "HASS", "CI-M", "CI-H"

**state**:
* a set of Courses with 
	* a name String
	* a set of Events
	* a set of Tags
	* other information
* a set of Events with 
	* a Course (the course that this is part of)
	* a type String (one of Lecture/Recitation/Lab)
	* a MeetingTime

**actions**:
* `defineCourse (name: String, tags: Tag[], events: (Event, type: String, times: MeetingTime)[]): (course: Course)`
    * **requires**: For each meeting time provided, `startTime < endTime`.  Course with given name doesn't exist
    * **effects**: Creates a new course in the set of Courses with defined lecture and optional recitation and lab times. This is typically an administrative action. 
* removeCourse (course: Course)
	* requires: course exists
	* effects: removes course from set of course and each of its events from the set of events

**queries:** 
* `_getAllCourses (): (courses: (course, name: String, tags: Tag[], events: (Event, type: String, times: MeetingTime))[])`
    * **effects**: Returns all `Courses` in the catalog with their information.
* \_getCourseInfo (courses: Course\[]): (name: String, tags: Tag[], events: (Event, type: String, times: MeetingTime))\[]
	* **requires:** courses exist
	* **effects:** returns the course info for each course
* \_getEventInfo (event: Event): (event: Event, name: String, type: String, times: MeetingTime)\[]
	* **requires:** event exists
	* **effects:** returns the MeetingTimes for given event
