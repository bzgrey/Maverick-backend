# prompt: Create a script for 4 people named Betsegaw, Benny, Giani, and Yabet for a 3 minute video. They will present their functional design not only as a document but also as a short video to be shared with the class, outlining the problem they're addressing and the key concepts of their design. These videos will be shown in junior-senior level college class,
# response:

Of course. Here is a script for a 3-minute video presentation, designed for four speakers, based on the provided problem framing document.

### **Video Script: CourseConnect**

**Team:** Betsegaw, Benny, Giani, Yabet
**Total Time:** ~3 minutes

**(Video opens with a shot of all four team members together, looking friendly and energetic. Music is upbeat but subtle.)**

**Giani (0:00 - 0:25)**
**(Smiling warmly at the camera)**
How many times have you been in a group chat that looks like this?
**(Visual: A chaotic phone screen mockup showing multiple screenshots of class schedules being shared, with messages like "Wait, what time is your 6.1010?", "Can you do Tuesday at 2?", "Ugh, that conflicts with my UROP.")**
It's pre-registration week. You're trying to figure out which classes to take, and more importantly, which classes you can take *with your friends*. It’s a mess of texts, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth. This isn't just inconvenient; it's a huge time sink that adds stress to an already stressful time of year.

**Benny (0:25 - 0:55)**
**(Steps forward slightly, adopting a more analytical tone)**
And Giani's not alone. This is a universal student problem. Research from Calendly shows that people waste a significant amount of time just trying to schedule things. More importantly, studies show that taking classes with friends measurably improves your grades and even reduces feelings of depression. Yet, our current tools fall short. Apps like Saturn have faced major privacy issues, and others like Coursicle aren't integrated with MIT’s systems, forcing you to enter everything manually.

**Yabet (0:55 - 1:20)**
**(Enthusiastic and clear)**
That's why we're designing **CourseConnect**: a smart, social scheduling app built by MIT students, for MIT students. Our goal is to take all the friction out of coordinating your academic life. It’s a single place where you can plan your semester, connect with your friends, and build your ideal schedule, together.
**(Visual: A clean, sleek logo for "CourseConnect" appears on screen.)**

**Betsegaw (1:20 - 2:05)**
**(Engaged, pointing to different areas of the screen as if demonstrating the app)**
So, how does it work? We're focusing on three core features.
First, **MIT Schedule Syncing**. No more manual entry. You’ll be able to import your schedule directly from university systems like Hydrant with a single click.
**(Visual: An animation showing a Hydrant schedule seamlessly appearing in the CourseConnect app interface.)**
Second, **Friends and Groups**. You can add your friends and create groups for clubs, sports, or dorms. This lets you instantly see schedule similarities and identify free time slots for group projects or just hanging out.
**(Visual: A "schedule similarity" view, showing overlapping classes and free times between three friends' schedules.)**
And finally, a feature for the reality of registration: **Likelihood Ranking**. You can tag classes as "Definitely Taking," "Likely," or "Just Shopping." This way, your friends know what your real plans are, making coordination far more accurate.
**(Visual: A class in a schedule is shown with a small dropdown tag that says "Likely".)**

**Giani (2:05 - 2:35)**
**(Tone becomes more serious and thoughtful)**
But a social app like this comes with responsibility. We’ve thought carefully about the ethics. To prevent misuse, like stalking, we’re requiring university email authentication, and you *only* share your schedule with confirmed friends. We’re also tackling the problem of social sorting—where everyone only takes classes with the same people. CourseConnect will include "diversity nudges" that highlight interesting classes outside your immediate friend group, encouraging academic exploration.

**Benny (2:35 - 3:00)**
**(Summarizing, bringing the presentation to a close)**
Ultimately, CourseConnect isn't just about finding a time slot. It’s about strengthening our community, improving academic success, and making college life a little less stressful. It helps you find time not just for the classes you have to take, but for the friends who make your time here worthwhile.
**(Visual: The whole team is back on screen, smiling.)**
Thanks for watching.

**(Outro music fades in. The CourseConnect logo and the four team members' names appear on the screen.)**
