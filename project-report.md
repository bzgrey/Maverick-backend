# 6.104 Project Report

## Design Summary

## Reflections
### Benny
As part of this project I learned and improved on many things. I improved on my ability to code concepts and syncs, and use the concept tool in the process. I also gained important experience in working in a team on building a webapp. I have also improved on my ability to use llms affectively while coding. I have enjoyed this process of working with a team and found that it is much more manageable than working individually on a project.

**Difficulties:

- A mistake my group and I made in the beginning was having less organized meetings that lasted very long, but at times resulted in very little progress. In order to avoid making this mistake in the future, it would be better to create a task lists with expected times for each task before each meeting. 
    
- Initially I expected it to be much easier to brainstorm ideas for our project since there were more ideas to bounce off of; however, this was more difficult than anticipated. 
    

- To make this easier next time maybe we could have come to our brainstorming meeting with three fleshed out ideas of our own to compare during the meeting. This would have likely saved more time. 
    
What went well/was easy:

- After the personal project, I felt so much more comfortable with using LLMs to code and experienced less “resistance” with the LLM tools context and cursor, and I understood how to communicate with the LLMs when resistance/conflict occurred. 
    
- Splitting work among 4 members by Concept made it so much easier to work independently since they are independent in nature, and collaboration for syncs went well as we all greatly understood the concepts we created because we were able to focus on only a couple concepts.
    
- Delegating work evenly was easier than expected and it was a really rewarding experience to be equally participating on an app as you feel you can rightfully take credit for the finished product
    
AI usage:

- Context was extremely helpful with taking our ideas for what we wanted in our app and giving use a set of possible concepts that could be helpful. We initially came up with our own set of concepts, but used context to confirm whether or not our set of concepts was reasonable. 
    
- Context was great at fleshing out concept specs and implementations
    
- Context was also great at creating an initial draft of syncs that we polished
    
- Cursor was extremely useful for creating a functional UI, but I found that making it MIT color themed with the LLM was much more difficult than when I polished the UI for my personal project. 
    
AI thoughts:

- I feel like as a developer learning about software AI usage at times did hinder learning as I felt that I could get away with a very basic understanding of full stack development
    
- However, it made creating an app much more fritionless and enjoyable as our ambitious ideas could come to life with less resistance than if we coded our entire code base independently**
