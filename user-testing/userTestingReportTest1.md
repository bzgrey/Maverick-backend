# Summary Report:
The participant was able to work through all of the core features, but there were a few points where they hesitated or seemed unsure about where to go next. The biggest early confusion came when they tried searching for courses in the friend search bar instead of the course search field. The two felt visually similar enough that they blended together. Once they found the correct one, they actually liked the search flow a lot and commented that searching by course name felt natural and smooth.

Setting preferences brought up another uncertainty. The user paused when adjusting the interest level, unsure whether the scale reflected how much they liked a class or just how strongly they cared about taking it. They did like the colored dots and said they helped visually, but the meaning wasn’t immediately obvious without explanation. A clearer label or quick tooltip would probably resolve that confusion.

Schedule comparison went well overall they liked being able to see overlap and probability of match, but also mentioned that things could get cluttered quickly if they were comparing schedules with several friends. They suggested pop-out views or overlapping blocks to help reduce visual noise. They also had trouble figuring out where to see which friends were in a specific course, which suggests that feature isn’t discoverable enough in its current layout.

Group creation was straightforward, though the user expected a popup or modal after clicking “create” instead of staying on the same page. They also assumed a group creator would be able to send invites, rather than waiting for others to join manually.

Blocking caused the most friction. The user first tried to block by tapping the person in their friend list, and even after blocking, the user still appeared, which made them think it didn’t work. They expected blocked users to disappear entirely or at least be visually separated.

Overall, the user really liked the idea behind the app and even mentioned they could imagine people using this for real scheduling meetups, which was encouraging. Their feedback highlighted several places where clarity and navigation could be tightened, but the general concept resonated strongly.



## Flaws & Opportunities for Improvement (from Test #1)

- **Course search mistaken for friend search**
  - The user initially searched for courses using the friend search bar.
  - Both search locations look similar, causing confusion about where to start.
  - **Improvement ideas:**
    - Add visual separation or spacing between the two search tools.
    - Update placeholder text to clarify intent (e.g., *Search Courses…* vs. *Find Friends…*).

---

- **Interest level meaning unclear**
  - The user wasn’t sure whether interest meant *liking the class* or *likelihood of enrolling*.
  - The colored dots looked appealing but weren’t self-explanatory.
  - **Improvement ideas:**
    - Add a one-line description or tooltip explaining interest levels.
    - Clarify in UI text what the interest indicator means and how it affects scheduling decisions.

---

- **Schedule comparison becomes visually cluttered**
  - Multiple schedules stacked together made the view crowded and harder to interpret.
  - Overlapping classes weren’t visually merged, increasing noise.
  - **Improvement ideas:**
    - Combine overlapping time blocks instead of duplicating them.
    - Add optional pop-out detail views for clearer breakdowns

---

- **Friends-in-course information is hard to find**
  - The user couldn’t immediately locate where shared-course friends appear.
  - The information is present but not visually emphasized.
  - **Improvement ideas:**
    - Add small friend icons directly on calendar course blocks.
    - Include a “friends in this class” pop-out or hover detail window.

---

- **Blocking functionality feels incomplete**
  - User attempted blocking through the friends list, not settings.
  - Blocked users remain visible, which felt counterintuitive and unclear.
  - **Improvement ideas:**
    - Add block option directly on friend profile cards.
    - Hide or visually separate blocked friends vs unblocked friends
